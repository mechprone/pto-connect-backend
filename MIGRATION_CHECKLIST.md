- [ ] Custom domain responding correctly
- [ ] All API endpoints working on custom domain
- [ ] Frontend successfully communicating with new backend

### Step 5: Post-Migration

  - [ ] Stripe webhook: `https://api.ptoconnect.com/api/stripe/webhook`
  - [ ] Other external services updated
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Error rates normal
- [ ] All integrations verified

## GitHub Integration Setup

### Repository Connection
- [ ] GitHub repository connected to Railway
- [ ] Auto-deploy on main branch enabled
- [ ] Preview deployments for PRs configured
- [ ] Branch protection rules set up

### CI/CD Pipeline

- [ ] Linting passing
- [ ] Security audit passing
- [ ] Health checks working

## Monitoring & Verification

### Health Checks
- [ ] `curl https://api.ptoconnect.com/` returns "PTO Connect API is running"
- [ ] All API endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Response times acceptable
- [ ] Error rates normal

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Frontend login working
- [ ] Database operations successful
- [ ] Stripe payments processing
- [ ] Email notifications sending
- [ ] SMS notifications working (if enabled)

### Performance Metrics

- [ ] Memory usage stable
- [ ] CPU usage normal
- [ ] No memory leaks detected

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur:
1. **Immediate Rollback:**
   - [ ] Change DNS back to Render CNAME
   - [ ] Verify Render is still operational
   - [ ] Monitor for traffic restoration

2. **Investigation:**
   - [ ] Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
   - [ ] Verify environment variables
   - [ ] Test individual endpoints
   - [ ] Check external service connectivity

3. **Fix and Retry:**
   - [ ] Address identified issues
   - [ ] Test thoroughly on Railway URL
   - [ ] Re-attempt DNS migration

## Success Criteria

### âœ… Technical Requirements
